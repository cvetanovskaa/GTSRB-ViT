# Vision Transformer Image Classifier for the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) Dataset

## The Critical Challenge of Traffic Sign Recognition
In the realm of autonomous vehicles, the accuracy of traffic sign recognition is paramount. However, current systems often falter under challenging conditions such as occlusions, weather changes, and lighting variations. This is not just a technical problem; it's a safety one. Missed or misclassified signs can compromise the reliability of autonomous vehicles, potentially leading to accidents. By enhancing the robustness of our recognition systems, we can prevent accidents and save lives.

## Why Vision Transformers?
So, why choose Vision Transformers for this task? Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Networks, Vision Transformers offer state-of-the-art accuracy with greater training efficiency. They excel at global contextual modeling, which is crucial for recognizing partially occluded traffic signs. Their flexible self-attention architecture adeptly handles varying shapes and aspects of traffic signs. Plus, their efficient design is ideal for real-time processing in autonomous vehicles, making them a perfect fit for our project.
